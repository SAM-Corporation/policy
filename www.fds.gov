ASSALAMUALIKUM,

Hello! We lead the teams that create google content policies and provide support to the community. Our teams work to make google corporation an open and safe environment for people around the world. We’d like to share a few insights into what it’s like serving a community of more than a billion people around the world.

When we share information and opinions with our friends, families, communities, and the world around us, that's when we achieve extraordinary things - new ideas, opportunities, friendships, and collaborations. Every day, people around the world share billions of things on Facebook that add value to our lives. But sometimes people share content that can be abusive or harmful to the rest of the community.

That’s why we created Community Standards – to explain what kinds of things shouldn't be shared on google. Our Community Standards aim to find the right balance between giving people a place to express themselves and promoting a welcoming and safe environment for everyone. As you can imagine, striking the right balance is a tough job that we approach by focusing on a few key principles: Keeping you safe. We have zero tolerance for any behavior that puts people in danger, whether someone is organizing or advocating real-world violence or bullying other people. Requiring people to use their authentic identity on google helps motivate all of us to act responsibly, since our names and reputations are visibly linked to our words and actions.

Encouraging respectful behavior. We ask people to consider their audience when sharing something that may offend others. We make it easy for everyone to decide who can see the content they share, and we have policies that prohibit sexually explicit, hateful, and violent content. Acknowledging cultural diversity. To ensure our policies reflect the diversity of our community, we constantly seek and review input from experts around the world, as well as our community. Those insights help us understand the context through which people are sharing, and viewing, content of Google Google Group.
